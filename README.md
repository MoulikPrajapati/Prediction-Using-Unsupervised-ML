# Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-ML
Unsupervised Machine Learning to generate clusters in a Data set.

In Unsupervised Machine Learning there is just an independent data is given in the data set fom that the clusters are formed.
Unsupervised Machine Learning gives result as the classes which particular data points belongs. This is done using the distance calculation between different data points and data points which are close forms separate clusters.

for this project the KMeans clustering technique is used to generate the clusters in the data set.
